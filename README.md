## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Waves AI is our desire to make the internet accessible to everyone, especially individuals with disabilities. We recognized that traditional web browsing methods can be challenging for those with conditions like arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, muscular dystrophy, visual impairments, or those who have suffered strokes. By developing a voice-activated browser extension, we aimed to eliminate these barriers and provide a more inclusive digital experience.

Waves AI is particularly beneficial for people with mobility impairments, such as those with spinal cord injuries or cerebral palsy, offering a hands-free browsing solution that enhances web interaction. It also aids those with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, ensuring they remain connected without additional strain. Our commitment to accessibility ensures that everyone, regardless of physical capabilities, can enjoy a seamless and independent browsing experience.

For us, the UC Berkeley AI Hackathon was the perfect opportunity to take a bold step and pursue our ambitious vision!
